This python program is compiled and executed successfully in the python IDE PyCharm with integrated environment Anaconda for python 3.5+. This program uses Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib to process data and plot charts which means you need these libraries to excute the program successfully and obtain the correct results. The most important thing is that you need to install famous Scikit-Learn,Scikit-Image,NLTK libraries of Python to excute the program successfully since this program will use some functions in those packages.

The data are stored in the "dataset" folder and images are stored in the "img" folder. You should keep the relative document paths as it is now to prevent program exceptions.

The main program wil use a lot of functions written by myself which are stored in pd_tools.py and common_tools.py, so when you run main.py you need to ensure that
those two documents are in the same folder to execute successfully.

All of the codes have annotations so that you can know the function of that piece of codes.
